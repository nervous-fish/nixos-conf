## TODO
- discord crashes after some time (actually, it crashes the system too)
- hyprland only starts one time out of two (this has something to do with the above)
- configure neovim
- find that super cool custom-made version of the super cool robot girl abstract wallpaper (probably impossible)
- rofi window doesn't work (says window doesn't exist)
- workspace shortcuts don't work
- rebind special shortcuts (fn + volume / luminosity)
